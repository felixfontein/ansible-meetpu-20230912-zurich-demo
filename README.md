# Demos for SOPS talk

These demos assume you have imported the test [PGP keys used in the sops functional tests](https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/main/pgp/sops_functional_tests_key.asc).

## plain demo

The `plain` directory contains a very simple demo: a basic `.sops.yaml`, and an `example.sops.yaml` file.

## ansible demo

The `ansible` directory contains demos for every community.sops plugin (but not for the roles and playbooks).

## Slides

The `slides` directory contains the LaTeX sources for the slides. The compiled slides are available in [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf).
